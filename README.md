# 5W_Roll_the_Dice_Game
the very first 100% self build  website/game.

i think i am better , when it comes to deal with backend or non-styling programming-problems.
but when it comes to Css, it is hard for me to see the bigger picture , the mechanism of css.

thats why my game looks very primitive and ugly, but on the other side it is fully functional and featured game ,it can store the score of who won every round , as a beginner i did my best to organize and clean write my JS-code, and to prove that i am capable of manipulating html/css with dom and JS, (but still my css-styling is poor)

almost every code line has a comment above it to explain IT.


Hope to hear comments  from you, on how to improve myself, what should i focus on more and what are my weakpoints.
